# ManuMaker
An Open-Source Documentation Tool

## THIS SOFTWARE IS CURRENTLY STILL UNDERGOING TESTING & FINETUNING, NO STABLE RELEASE AVAILABLE YET

ManuMaker is a software-tool which is aimed at people who need to create single-language documentation for products or tasks, such as:
- Assembly manuals 
- Maintenance manuals 
- User guides

It works for both Hard- and Software documentation, as it facilitates insertion of screenshots as well as the capture of still-images via USB-Webcam.

Since it is written in Java, it *should* run on most platforms, but it has only been tested on Win 8.1 so far.
