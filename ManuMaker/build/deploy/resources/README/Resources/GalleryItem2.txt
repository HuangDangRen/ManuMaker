§->ManuMaker: Name of the Application this manual describes. This manual was created for ManuMaker, with ManuMaker. The screen capture and highlighting of image-features was achieved using the very capable tool "Greenshot". ->Gallery: The currently opened project in ManuMaker is also occasionally referred to as "The Gallery". This is owed to the fact that the reader navigates from one item to the next in a mostly linear fashion, just like someone would do in e.g. an art gallery. Jumping to the part which interests you the most is also allowed, via use of the slide list / tag search.  ->Gallery Slide: The items in the Gallery are also referred to as "Slides". This is due to the similarities to slides in a digital presentation program. Every Slide has a Slide Title which is displayed in the title-bar above the image and text editor, as well as in the slide list. ->Slide List: The list at the left side of the window. It has two tabs, one which permanently displays all slides in the current Gallery (Labeled "Index") and one which displays all slides matching your search keywords, if there are any. ->Image View: The Element in the center of the window. The current slide's images are displayed here, if the current slide contains an image. In Draft Mode, the ImageView is presented as a grey rectangle even if no picture is present, in the other two modes the Image View's width is shrunk to zero if the current slide contains no image, to make more space for the text.  ->Annotation: refers to the text of a Gallery Slide which usually contains instructions. There are two different annotations attached to each slide: Draft - and Final (or Refined) Text. The Refined text is the one visible to the reader of the manual, and can be stiled in a WYSIWYG manner in the Refine Tab. ->Gallery Browser: The part of the UI which displays a given project. If you've opened this manual within ManuMaker, you're looking at the GalleryBrowser right now.  ->Project, or the current Project: The manual currently being created or viewed in ManuMaker. Each instance of the software can only load one Project at a time. ->Application Settings: The window where the settings which are constant across all projects are selected. Mainly the Camera-related options at this point.  -> Project Settings: Every Project has a set of settings attached to it, which are unique to the project. All of these can be set at the creation of a new project, but only a few fields are mandatory. All settings for the current project can be changed at any time via the Settings->Project Settings menu. The Project is automatically updated with the new information (e.g. information on the title slide)
