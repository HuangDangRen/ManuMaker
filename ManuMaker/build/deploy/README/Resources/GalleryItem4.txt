§<html dir="ltr"><head></head><body contenteditable="true"><h3><font face="Segoe UI" size="4">Limitations to be aware of:</font></h3><h4><font face="Segoe UI">Technical:</font></h4><p></p><ul><li><font face="Segoe UI"><b>A webcam</b> connected to a computer can only be used by one application at the time. If the webcam selected in ManuMaker's <b>Application Settings</b>&nbsp;is already in use elsewhere when an instance of ManuMaker is starting up, it will not be usable in that new instance. The Application will notify you if a webcam is not available. If multiple webcams are connected to the system, go to Application Settings to select an available one, if needed. For just viewing a documentation or for documenting on-screen subjects, a webcam is not required.&nbsp;<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI"><b>The elements of a ManuMaker project</b> are saved in common formats such as .txt, .html and .png for simplicity's sake, and because this makes integration of a documentation project easier in the context of a versioning system like e.g. Subversion. Some drawbacks of this storage format are:&nbsp;</font></li><ul><li><font face="Segoe UI">Component files can be corrupted accidentally by accessing and modifying them through the file explorer</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">Components can be opened externally and therefore not be writable when ManuMaker is attempting to save the current project. This may result in loss of data.</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">When copying a documentation project (e.g. when restoring a corrupted documentation from backup), great care has to be taken that it is a clean copy. <br>If a directory "Dir" contains a project with name "Project A" and another project named "Project A" is copied into the same directory, your OS may ask you to merge the project folders in some way. <br>That may leave residual data of the initial project in "Dir" in the project structure, and cause ManuMaker to load wrong or incomplete data when loading from the merged folder.&nbsp;<br><br></font></li></ul><li><font face="Segoe UI"><b>Use with constantly updating versioning- or cloud services </b>can lead to loss of data because the updater may block a file while ManuMaker tries to modify it. <br><b><i>Workaround: </i></b>Disable automatic updates of the file structure while handling documentation, or use a manual-commit based service. <br><i><b>Known cases where data-loss occured:</b></i></font></li><ul><li><font face="Segoe UI">Documentation Project saved in Dropbox (only service on hand during testing)&nbsp;</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">This list will be expanded as information is collected<br><br></font></li></ul><li><font face="Segoe UI"><b>The Export to printable HTML funtion: </b>It works when the conditions are right, although there are no customization options available in the current version of ManuMaker (The default setting is: Portrait orientation, 1 Slide per Page). Please refer to the chapter "<i>Exporting the Project to HTML Format</i>" in this manual for some guidelines on how to create a printable ManuMaker project.</font></li></ul><h4><font face="Segoe UI">Conceptual:</font></h4><p></p><ul><li><font face="Segoe UI"><b>Multi-Topic-Manuals:</b> Due to the shallow structure of the documentation projects created in ManuMaker (only project-&gt;chapters-&gt;instructions, no sub-chapters), it is recommended to limit a documentation project to one specific task, e.g. assembly of an apparatus. <br>If a product needs a manual consisting of several instruction-sets such as assembly, commissioning, troubleshooting, and maintenance, it is recommended to create one ManuMaker-project for each purpose, to avoid making the documentation difficult to navigate through.<br><br></font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI"><b>Complex Troubleshooting: </b>To troubleshoot a complicated product, the corresponding manual likely requires a lot of cross-references ("If situation A occurs, read on on page X, read page Y for situation B...). Reasons are:&nbsp;</font></li><ul><li><font face="Segoe UI">ManuMaker V1.0 does not support embedded links between slides</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">Slide titles may be reformulated ad-hoc during the refinement process, as better formulations come to mind, which requires an impractical amount of management-overhead of references-by-slide-title.</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">The slide- and chapter numbers change across the whole project when a slide is inserted near the beginning of the manual, making manual referencing by chapter- or slide number impractical.</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">A possible workaround would be to use the tag-search feature for cross referencing ("If situation A occurs, type &lt;code A&gt; into the search box and keep reading..."). Then it is just a matter of distributing unique tags to the referenced slides. But since these links need to be managed by the documenter, this workaround is not an ideal solution.</font></li><li><font face="Segoe UI">For troubleshooting situations, flowcharts can be very helpful. As of ManuMaker V1.0, importing flowcharts in e.g. an XML form is not supported. <br>While inserting images of flowcharts may work for small charts, the lack of a zoom and scroll functionality in ManuMaker's&nbsp;<b>image view</b>&nbsp;makes viewing large images impractical.</font></li></ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</body></html>&nbsp;&nbsp;
